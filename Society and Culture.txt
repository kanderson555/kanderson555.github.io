			<h1>Society and Culture</h1>

				<h3>Break</h3>
					<p>A <em>coffee break</em> in the United States and elsewhere is a short mid-morning rest period granted to employees in business and indu
stry, corresponding with the Commonwealth terms <em>"elevenses"</em>, <em>"smoko"</em> (in Australia), <em>"morning tea"</em>, <em>"tea break"</em>, or even just <em>"tea"</em>. An afternoon coffee break, or afterno
on tea, often occurs as well.</p>

					<p>The coffee break originated in the late 19th century in Stoughton, Wisconsin, with the wives of Norwegian immigrants. The city c
elebrates this every year with the Stoughton Coffee Break Festival. In 1951, Time noted that "Since the war, the coffee break has been written into union contracts".
 The term subsequently became popular through a Pan-American Coffee Bureau ad campaign of 1952 which urged consumers, "Give yourself a Coffee-Break – and Get What Coffee Give
s to You." John B. Watson, a behavioral psychologist who worked with Maxwell House later in his career, helped to popularize coffee breaks within the American culture. Co
ffee breaks usually last from 10 to 20 minutes and frequently occur at the end of the first third of the work shift. In some companies and some civil service, the coffee br
eak may be observed formally at a set hour. In some places, a cart with hot and cold beverages and cakes, breads and pastries arrives at the same time morning and afternoon
, an employer may contract with an outside caterer for daily service, or coffee breaks may take place away from the actual work-area in a designated cafeteria or tea room. M
ore generally, the phrase "coffee break" has also come to denote any break from work.</p>

				<h3>Prohibition and Condemnation</h3>

					<p>At least 1,100 years ago, traders brought coffee across the Red Sea into 
Arabia (modern-day Yemen), where Muslim dervishes began cultivating the shrub in their gardens. At first, the Arabians made wine from the pulp of the fermented coffee berries. 
This beverage was known as qishr (kisher in modern usage) and was used during religious ceremonies.</p>

					<p>An ulema of jurists and scholars meeting in Mecca in 1511 prohibited coffee drinking as haraam, but whether coffee was intoxicating 
was hotly debated over the next 30 years until the ban was finally overturned in the mid-16th century. Use in religious rites among the Sufi branch of Islam led to coffee's
 being put on trial in Mecca: it was accused of being a heretical substance, and its production and consumption were briefly repressed. An edict of Sultan Murad IV
 (r. 1623–1640) later prohibited it in Ottoman Turkey.</p>

					<p>A contemporary example of religious prohibition of coffee can be found in <em>The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</em>.
 The organization regards the consumption of coffee as both physically and spiritually unhealthy. This attitude comes from the Mormon doctrine of health, published
 in 1833 by founder Joseph Smith in a revelation called the "Word of Wisdom". This text does not identify coffee by name, but includes the statement that "hot drinks are 
not for the belly", which Latter-day Saints have interpreted as forbidding both coffee and tea.</p>

					<p>Quite a number of members of the <em>Seventh-day Adventist Church</em> also avoid caffeinated drinks. In its teachings, the Church
 encourages members to avoid tea, coffee, and other stimulants. Abstinence from coffee, tobacco, and alcohol by many Adventists has afforded a near-unique opportunity 
for studies to be conducted within that population group on the health effects of coffee drinking, free from confounding factors. One study showed a weak but statistically s
ignificant association between coffee consumption and mortality from ischemic heart disease, other cardiovascular disease, all cardiovascular diseases combined, and all 
causes of death.</p>

					<p>For a time, controversy existed in the <em>Jewish</em> community over whether the coffee seed was a legume – and therefore prohibited for P
assover. Upon petition from coffeemaker Maxwell House, orthodox Jewish rabbi Hersch Kohn in 1923 classified the coffee seed as a berry rather than as a seed, and therefo
re kosher for Passover.</p>

				<h3>Fair trade</h3>

					<p>The concept of fair trade labeling, which guarantees coffee growers a negotiated preharvest price, began in the late 1980s with the 
Max Havelaar Foundation's labeling program in the Netherlands. In 2004, 24,222 metric tons (of 7,050,000 produced worldwide) were fair trade; in 2005, 33,991 metric tons out 
of 6,685,000 were fair trade, an increase from 0.34% to 0.51%. A number of fair trade impact studies have shown that fair trade coffee produces a mixed impact on the
 communities that grow it. Many studies are skeptical about fair trade, reporting that it often worsens the bargaining power of those who are not part of it. The very first fa
ir-trade coffee was an effort to import a Guatemalan coffee into Europe as "Indio Solidarity Coffee".</p>

					<p>Since the founding of organizations such as the European Fair Trade Association (1987), the production and consumption of f
air trade coffee has grown as some local and national coffee chains started to offer fair trade alternatives. For example, in April 2000, after a year-long 
campaign by the human rights organization Global Exchange, Starbucks decided to carry fair-trade coffee in its stores. Since September 2009 all Starbucks Espress
o beverages in UK and Ireland are made with Fairtrade and Shared Planet certified coffee.</p>

					<p>A 2005 study done in Belgium concluded that consumers' buying behavior is not consistent with their positive attitude tow
ard ethical products. On average 46% of European consumers claimed to be willing to pay substantially more for ethical products, including fair-trade products such a
s coffee. The study found that the majority of respondents were unwilling to pay the actual price premium of 27% for fair trade coffee.</p>

				<h3>Folklore and culture</h3>
					<p>The <em>Oromo</em> people would customarily plant a coffee tree on the graves of powerful sorcerers. They believed that the first
 coffee bush sprang up from the tears that the god of heaven shed over the corpse of a dead sorcerer.</p>

					<p>Johann Sebastian Bach was inspired to compose the humorous Coffee Cantata, about dependence on the beverage, which was 
controversial in the early 18th century.</p>

				<h3>Economic impacts</h3>

					<p>Market volatility, and thus increased returns, during 1830 encouraged Brazilian entrepreneurs to shift their attention from
 gold to coffee, a crop hitherto reserved for local consumption. Concurrent with this shift was the commissioning of vital infrastructures, including approximately 7,00
0 km of railroads between 1860 and 1885. The creation of these railways enabled the importation of workers, to meet the enormous need for labor. This development primaril
y affected the State of Rio de Janeiro, as well as the Southern States of Brazil, most notably São Paulo, due to its favorable climate, soils, and terrain.</p>

					<p>Coffee production attracted immigrants in search of better economic opportunities in the early 1900s. Mainly, these were
 Portuguese, Italian, Spanish, German, and Japanese nationals. For instance, São Paulo received approximately 733,000 immigrants in the decade preceding 1900, whilst
 only receiving approximately 201,000 immigrants in the six years to 1890. The production yield of coffee increases. In 1880, São Paulo produced 1.2 million bags (25
% of total production), in 1888 2.6 million (40%), in 1902 8 million bags (60%). Coffee is then 63% of the country's exports. The gains made by this trade allow
 sustained economic growth in the country.</p>

					<p>The four years between planting a coffee and the first harvest extends seasonal variations in the price of coffee. The Bra
zilian Government is thus forced, to some extent, to keep strong price subsidies during production periods.</p>

				<h3>Competition</h3>
					<p>Coffee competitions take place across the globe with people at the regional competing to achieve national titles and then
 compete on the international stage. World Coffee Events holds the largest of such events moving the location of the final competition each year. The competition incl
udes the following events: <strong>Barista Championship</strong>, <strong>Brewers Cup</strong>, <strong>Latte Art</strong> and <strong>Cup Tasters</strong>. A World Brewer's Cup Championship takes place in Melbourne, Australia, every y
ear that houses contestants from around the world to crown the World's Coffee King.</p>
