			<h1>Health Effects</h1>

					<p>A 2017 review of clinical trials found that drinking coffee is generally safe within usual levels of intake and is more likely to 
improve health outcomes than to cause harm at doses of 3 or 4 cups of coffee daily. Exceptions include possible increased risk in women having <em>bone fractures</em>, and a 
possible increased risk in pregnant women of <em>fetal loss</em> or <em>decreased birth weight</em>. Results were complicated by poor study quality, and differences in age, gender, 
health status, and serving size.</p>

				<h3>Digestion</h3>
					<p>A 1999 review found that coffee does not cause indigestion, but may promote <em>gastrointestinal reflux</em>. Two reviews of clinical 
studies on people recovering from abdominal, colorectal, and gynecological surgery found that coffee consumption was safe and effective for <em>enhancing postoperative 
gastrointestinal function</em>.</p>

				<h3>Mortality</h3>
					<p>In 2012, the National Institutes of Health–AARP Diet and Health Study found that higher coffee consumption was associated with 
lower risk of death, and that those who drank any coffee lived longer than those who did not. However the authors noted, "whether this was a causal or associational 
finding cannot be determined from our data." A 2014 meta-analysis found that coffee consumption (4 cups/day) was inversely associated with all-cause mortality 
(a 16% lower risk), as well as cardiovascular disease mortality specifically (a 21% lower risk from drinking 3 cups/day), but not with cancer mortality with exception 
being oral cancer mortality.</p>

					<p>Additional meta-analyses corroborated these findings, showing that higher coffee consumption (2–4 cups per day) was associated 
with a reduced risk of death by all disease causes. An association of coffee drinking with reduced risk for death from various sources was confirmed by a widely cited 
prospective cohort study of ten European countries in 2017.</p>

				<h3>Cardiovascular disease</h3>
					<p>Moderate coffee consumption is not a risk factor for coronary heart disease. A 2012 meta-analysis concluded that people 
who drank moderate amounts of coffee had a lower rate of heart failure, with the biggest effect found for those who drank more than four cups a day. A 2014 meta-analysis 
concluded that cardiovascular disease, such as coronary artery disease and stroke, is less likely with three to five cups of non-decaffeinated coffee per day, but 
more likely with over five cups per day. A 2016 meta-analysis showed that coffee consumption was associated with a reduced risk of death in patients who have had a 
myocardial infarction.</p>

					<p>The effect of no or moderate daily consumption of coffee on risk for developing hypertension has been assessed in several 
reviews during the 21st century. A 2019 review found that one to two cups consumed per day had no effect on hypertension risk, whereas drinking three or more cups 
per day reduced the risk, a finding in agreement with a 2017 analysis which showed a 9% lower risk of hypertension with long-term consumption of up to seven cups 
of coffee per day. Another review in 2018 found that the risk of hypertension was reduced by 2% with each one cup per day increment of coffee consumption up to 8 cups 
per day, compared with people who did not consume any coffee. By contrast, a 2011 review had found that drinking one to three cups of coffee per day may pose a 
slightly increased risk of developing hypertension.</p>

				<h3>Mental health</h3>
					<p>The UK NHS advises that avoiding coffee may reduce anxiety. Caffeine, the major active ingredient in coffee, is associated 
with <strong>anxiety</strong>. At high doses, typically greater than 300 mg, caffeine can both cause and worsen anxiety. For some people, discontinuing caffeine use can significantly 
reduce anxiety. Caffeine-induced anxiety disorder is a subclass of substance- or medication-induced anxiety disorder. Populations that may be most impacted 
by caffeine consumption are adolescents and those already suffering anxiety disorders. Preliminary research indicated the possibility of a beneficial relationship 
between coffee intake and reduced depression. Long-term preliminary research, including assessment of symptoms for dementia and cognitive impairment, was inconclusive 
for coffee having an effect in the elderly, mainly due to the poor quality of the studies.</p>

				<h3>Parkinson's disease</h3>
					<p>Meta-analyses have consistently found that long-term coffee consumption is associated with a lower risk of Parkinson's disease.</p>

				<h3>Type II diabetes</h3>
					<p>In a systematic review and meta-analysis of 28 prospective observational studies, representing over one million participants, 
every additional cup of caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee consumed in a day was associated, respectively, with a 9% and 6% lower risk of type 2 diabetes.</p>

				<h3>Cancer</h3>
					<p>Research on the effects of coffee consumption on cancer risk generally has indicated no effect or a slightly lower risk of 
cancer, particularly in the liver.</p>

				<h3>Liver disease</h3>
					<p>Increasing evidence has shown that coffee consumption is protective against the progression of liver disease to cirrhosis. 
This is associated with antioxidant and anti-fibrotic effects of coffee.</p>

				<h3>Pharmacology</h3>

					<p>One psychoactive chemical in coffee is caffeine, an adenosine receptor antagonist that is known for its stimulant effects.
 Coffee also contains the monoamine oxidase inhibitors β-carboline and harmane, which may contribute to its psychoactivity.</p>

					<p>In a healthy liver, caffeine is mostly broken down by hepatic enzymes. The excreted metabolites are mostly paraxanthines—th
eobromine and theophylline—and a small amount of unchanged caffeine. Therefore, the metabolism of caffeine depends on the state of this enzymatic system of the liver.</p>

					<p>Polyphenols in coffee have been shown to affect free radicals in vitro, but there is no evidence that this effect occurs
 in humans. Polyphenol levels vary depending on how beans are roasted as well as for how long. As interpreted by the Linus Pauling Institute and the European Food Safety
 Authority, dietary polyphenols, such as those ingested by consuming coffee, have little or no direct antioxidant value following ingestion.</p>

				<h3>Caffeine content</h3>

					<p>Depending on the type of coffee and method of preparation, the caffeine content of a single serving can vary greatly.
 The caffeine content of a cup of coffee varies depending mainly on the brewing method, and also on the coffee variety. According to the USDA National Nutrient Dat
abase, a 240-millilitre (8 US fl oz) cup of "coffee brewed from grounds" contains 95 mg caffeine, whereas an espresso (25 ml) contains 53 mg.</p>

					
					<p>Caffeine remains stable up to 200 °C (392 °F) and completely decomposes around 285 °C (545 °F). Given that roasting 
temperatures don't exceed 200 °C (392 °F) for long and rarely if ever reach 285 °C (545 °F), the caffeine content of a coffee is not likely changed much by the roasting process.</p>
