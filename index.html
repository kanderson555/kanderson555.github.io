		<h1>Coffee</h1>
			<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<p>Coffee is a <strong>brewed drink</strong> prepared from roasted coffee beans, the seeds of berries from certain Coffea species. From the coffee fruit, the seeds are separated to produce 
a stable, raw product: unroasted green coffee. The seeds are then <em>roasted</em>, a process which transforms them into a consumable product: <strong>roasted coffee</strong>, which is ground 
into a powder and typically steeped in hot water before being filtered out, producing a cup of coffee.</p>

				<p>Coffee is darkly colored, bitter, slightly acidic and has a stimulating effect in humans, primarily due to its <em>caffeine content</em>. It is one of the most popular drinks in the world,
 and can be prepared and presented in a variety of ways (e.g., espresso, French press, caffè latte, or already-brewed canned coffee). It is usually served hot, although chilled 
or iced coffee is common. Sugar, sugar substitutes, milk or cream are often used to lessen the bitter taste. It may be served with coffee cake or another sweet dessert like doug
hnuts. A commercial establishment that sells prepared coffee beverages is known as a <strong>coffee shop</strong>.</p>

				<p>Clinical research indicates that moderate coffee consumption is benign or <em>mildly beneficial</em> as a stimulant in healthy adults, with continuing research on whether long-term cons
umption reduces the risk of some diseases, although some of the long-term studies are of questionable credibility.</p>

				<p>The earliest credible evidence of coffee-drinking as the modern beverage appears in modern-day Yemen from the middle of the 15th century in Sufi shrines, where coffee seeds we
re first roasted and brewed in a manner similar to how it is now prepared for drinking. The Yemenis procured the coffee beans from the Ethiopian Highlands via coastal 
Somali intermediaries, and began cultivation. By the 16th century, the drink had reached the rest of the Middle East and North Africa, later spreading to Europe.</p>


			<h2>Production</h2>
				<h3>Processing</h3>
					<p>Coffee berries and their seeds undergo several processes before they become the familiar roasted coffee. Berries have been traditi
onally selectively <em>picked by hand</em>; a labor-intensive method, it involves the selection of only the berries at the peak of ripeness. More commonly, crops are <em>strip picked</em>, w
here all berries are harvested simultaneously regardless of ripeness by person or machine. After picking, green coffee is processed by one of two types of method—a dry proc
ess type of method which is often simpler and less labor-intensive, and a wet process type of method, which incorporates <em>batch fermentation</em>, uses larger amounts of water in
 the process, and often yields a milder coffee.</p>

					<p>Then they are <em>sorted by ripeness and color</em>, and most often the flesh of the berry is removed, usually by machine, and the see
ds are fermented to remove the slimy layer of mucilage still present on the seed. When the fermentation is finished, the seeds are <em>washed with large quantities of fresh w
ater</em> to remove the fermentation residue, which generates massive amounts of coffee wastewater. Finally, the seeds are <em>dried</em>.</p>

					<p>The best (but least used) method of drying coffee is using <strong>drying tables</strong>. In this method, the pulped and fermented coffee is 
spread thinly on raised beds, which allows the air to pass on all sides of the coffee, and then the coffee is mixed by hand. In this method the drying that takes pl
ace is more uniform, and fermentation is less likely. Most African coffee is dried in this manner and certain coffee farms around the world are starting to use this 
traditional method.</p>

					<p>Next, the coffee is sorted, and labeled as <strong>green coffee</strong>. Some companies use cylinders to pump in heated air to dry the coffee seeds, though this is generally in places w
here the humidity is very high.</p>

				<h3>Roasting</h3>
					<p>The next step in the process is the <strong>roasting</strong> of the green coffee. Coffee is usually sold in a roasted state, and with rare excepti
ons, such as infusions from green coffee beans, coffee is roasted before it is consumed. It can be sold roasted by the supplier, or it can be home roasted. The roast
ing process influences the taste of the beverage by changing the coffee bean both physically and chemically. The bean decreases in weight as moisture is lost and increases 
in volume, causing it to become less dense. The density of the bean also influences the strength of the coffee and requirements for packaging.</p>

					<p>The actual roasting begins when the temperature inside the bean reaches approximately <strong>200 °C (392 °F)</strong>, though different varie
ties of seeds differ in moisture and density and therefore roast at different rates. During roasting, caramelization occurs as intense heat breaks down starches, cha
nging them to simple sugars that begin to brown, which alters the color of the bean.</p>

					<p>Sucrose is rapidly lost during the roasting process, and may disappear entirely in darker roasts. During roasting, aromat
ic oils and acids weaken, changing the flavor; at 205 °C (401 °F), other oils start to develop. One of these oils, caffeol, is created at about 200 °C (392 °F),
 which is largely responsible for coffee's <em>aroma and flavor</em>.</p>

					<p><strong>Roasting</strong> is the last step of processing the beans in their intact state. During this last treatment, while still in the bean
 state, more caffeine breaks down above 235 °C (455 °F). Dark roasting is the utmost step in bean processing removing the most caffeine. Although, dark roasting is 
<em>not</em> to be confused with the decaffeination process.</p>

				<h3>Grading Roasted Beans</h3>
					<p>Depending on the color of the roasted beans as perceived by the human eye, they will be labeled as <em>light</em>, <em>medium light</em>, <em>medi
um</em>, <em>medium dark</em>, <em>dark</em>, or <em>very dark</em>. A more accurate method of discerning the degree of roast involves measuring the reflected light from roasted seeds illuminated with 
a light source in the near-infrared spectrum. This elaborate light meter uses a process known as spectroscopy to return a number that consistently indicates the roasted 
coffee's relative degree of roast or flavor development.</p>

			<h3>Roast characteristics</h3>
					<p>The <strong>degree of roast</strong> has an effect upon coffee flavor and body. Darker roasts are generally <strong>bolder</strong> because they have less fiber content and a 
more sugary flavor. Lighter roasts have a more complex and therefore <strong>perceived stronger flavor</strong> from aromatic oils and acids otherwise destroyed by longer roasting times. Roasting 
does not alter the amount of caffeine in the bean, but does give less caffeine when the beans are measured by volume because the beans expand during roasting.</p>

					<p>A small amount of chaff is produced during roasting from the skin left on the seed after processing. Chaff is usually removed from the seeds by air movement, though a small amount is added to dark roast coffees to soak up oils on the seeds.[96]

				<h3>Decaffeination</h3>
					<p>Decaffeination of coffee seeds is done while the seeds are <em>still green</em>. Many methods can remove caffeine from coffee, but all involve 
either soaking the green seeds in hot water (often called the <em>"Swiss water process"</em>) or <em>steaming them</em>, then using a <strong>solvent</strong> to dissolve caffeine-containing oils. Decaffeination 
is often done by processing companies, and the extracted caffeine is usually sold to the <strong>pharmaceutical industry</strong>.</p>

				<h3>Storage</h3>

					<p>Coffee is best stored in an airtight container made of <strong>ceramic, glass or non-reactive metal</strong>. Higher quality prepackaged coffee 
usually has a one-way valve which prevents air from entering while allowing the coffee to release gases. Coffee freshness and flavor is preserved when it is stored 
<em>away from</em> moisture, heat, and light. The tendency of coffee to absorb strong smells from food means that it should be kept away from such smells. Storage of coffee in 
refrigerators is <strong>not recommended</strong> due to the presence of moisture which can cause deterioration. Exterior walls of buildings which face the sun may heat the interior of a 
home, and this heat may damage coffee stored near such a wall. Heat from nearby ovens also harms stored coffee.</p>

					<p>In 1931, a method of packing coffee in a sealed vacuum in cans was introduced. The roasted coffee was packed and then 99% of 
the air was removed, allowing the coffee to be stored indefinitely until the can was opened. Today this method is in mass use for coffee in a large part of the world.</p>

				<h3>Brewing</h3>

					<p>Coffee beans must be ground and brewed to create a beverage. The criteria for choosing a method include flavor and economy. Almost 
all methods of preparing coffee require that the beans be <em>ground</em> and then mixed with hot water long enough to allow the flavor to emerge but not so long as to draw out bitter 
compounds. The liquid can be consumed after the spent grounds are removed. Brewing considerations include the <em>fineness of grind</em>, the <em>way in which the water is used to extract 
the flavor</em>, the <em>ratio of coffee grounds to water (the brew ratio)</em>, <em>additional flavorings</em> such as sugar, milk, and spices, and the <em>technique to be used to separate spent grounds</em>. 
Optimal coffee extraction occurs between <strong>91 and 96 °C (196 and 205 °F)</strong>. Ideal holding temperatures range from <strong>85 to 88 °C (185 to 190 °F)</strong> to as high as <strong>93 °C (199 °F)</strong> and 
the ideal serving temperature is <strong>68 to 79 °C (154 to 174 °F)</strong>. The recommended brew ratio for non-espresso coffee is around 55 to 60 grams of grounds per litre of water, or 
<strong>two level tablespoons</strong> for a 150-to-180-millilitre (5 to 6 US fl oz) cup.</p>

					<p>The roasted coffee beans may be ground at a <strong>roastery</strong>, in a <strong>grocery store</strong>, or in <strong>the home</strong>. Most coffee is roasted and ground at a roastery 
and sold in packaged form, though roasted coffee beans can be ground at home immediately before consumption. It is also possible, though uncommon, to <strong>roast raw beans at home</strong>.</p>

					<p>Coffee beans may be ground in various ways. A <em>burr grinder</em> uses revolving elements to shear the seed; a <em>blade grinder</em> cuts the seeds 
with blades moving at high speed; and a <em>mortar and pestle</em> crushes the seeds. For most brewing methods a <em>burr grinder</em> is deemed superior because the grind is more even and the 
grind size can be adjusted.</p>

					<p>The type of grind is often named after the brewing method for which it is generally used. Turkish grind is the finest grind, while 
coffee percolator or French press are the coarsest grinds. The most common grinds are between these two extremes: a medium grind is used in most home coffee-brewing machines.</p>

					<p>Coffee may be brewed by several methods. It may be <em>boiled</em>, <em>steeped</em>, or <em>pressurized</em>.</p>

					<p>Brewing coffee by <em>boiling</em> was the earliest method, and Turkish coffee is an example of this method. It is prepared by grinding 
or pounding the seeds to a <strong>fine powder</strong>, then adding it to water and bringing it to the boil for no more than an instant in a pot called a <em>cezve</em> or, in Greek, a <em>μπρίκι : 
bríki</em> (from Turkish ibrik). This produces a strong coffee with a layer of foam on the surface and sediment (which is not meant for drinking) settling at the bottom of the cup.</p>

					<p>Coffee percolators and automatic coffeemakers brew coffee using gravity. In an automatic coffeemaker, hot water drips onto coffee 
grounds that are held in a paper, plastic, or perforated metal coffee filter, allowing the water to seep through the ground coffee while extracting its oils and essences. 
The liquid drips through the coffee and the filter into a carafe or pot, and the spent grounds are retained in the filter.</p>

					<p>In a percolator, boiling water is forced into a chamber above a filter by steam pressure created by boiling. The water then seeps through the grounds, and the process is 
repeated until terminated by removing from the heat, by an internal timer, or by a thermostat that turns off the heater when the entire pot reaches a certain temperature.</p>

					<p>Coffee may be brewed by steeping in a device such as a <em>French press</em> (also known as a <em>cafetière</em>, <em>coffee press</em> or <em>coffee plunger</em>). 
Ground coffee and hot water are combined 
in a cylindrical vessel and left to brew for a few minutes. A circular filter which fits tightly in the cylinder fixed to a plunger is then pushed down from the top to force 
the grounds to the bottom. The filter retains the grounds at the bottom as the coffee is poured from the container. Because the coffee grounds are in direct contact with the 
water, all the coffee oils remain in the liquid, making it a stronger beverage. This method of brewing leaves more sediment than in coffee made by an automatic coffee machine. 
Supporters of the French press method point out that the sediment issue can be minimized by using the right type of grinder: they claim that a rotary blade grinder cuts the coffee 
bean into a wide range of sizes, including a fine coffee dust that remains as sludge at the bottom of the cup, while a burr grinder uniformly grinds the beans into consistently-
sized grinds, allowing the coffee to settle uniformly and be trapped by the press. Within the first minute of brewing 95% of the caffeine is released from the coffee bean.</p>

					<p>The <em>espresso method</em> forces hot pressurized and vaporized water through ground coffee. As a result of brewing under high pressure 
(typically 9 bar), the espresso beverage is more concentrated (as much as 10 to 15 times the quantity of coffee to water as gravity-brewing methods can produce) and 
has a more complex physical and chemical constitution. A well-prepared espresso has a reddish-brown foam called crema that floats on the surface. Other pressurized 
water methods include the moka pot and vacuum coffee maker.</p>

					<p><em>Cold brew coffee</em> is made by steeping coarsely ground beans in cold water for several hours, then filtering them. This results 
in a brew lower in acidity than most hot-brewing methods.</p>

				<h3>Nutrition</h3>
					<p>Brewed coffee from typical grounds prepared with tap water contains 40 mg caffeine per 100 gram and no essential nutrients in 
significant content.[116] In espresso, however, likely due to its higher amount of suspended solids, there are significant contents of magnesium, the B vitamins, niacin 
and riboflavin, and 212 mg of caffeine per 100 grams of grounds.</p>

				<h3>Serving</h3>

					<p>Once brewed, coffee may be served in a variety of ways. <em>Drip-brewed</em>, <em>percolated</em>, or <em>French-pressed/cafetière</em> coffee may be 
served as white coffee with a dairy product such as milk or cream, or dairy substitute, or as black coffee with no such addition. It may be sweetened with sugar or 
artificial sweetener. When served cold, it is called <em>iced coffee</em>.</p>

					<p><em>Espresso-based coffee</em> has a variety of possible presentations. In its most basic form, an espresso is served alone as a <em>shot</em> 
or <em>short black</em>, or with hot water added, when it is known as <em>Caffè Americano</em>. A <em>long black</em> is made by pouring a double espresso into an equal portion of water, retaining 
the crema, unlike Caffè Americano. Milk is added in various forms to an espresso: steamed milk makes a <em>caffè latte</em>, equal parts steamed milk and milk froth make a 
<em>cappuccino</em>, and a dollop of hot foamed milk on top creates a <em>caffè macchiato</em>. A flat white is prepared by adding steamed hot milk (microfoam) to espresso so that the flavour is 
brought out and the texture is unusually velvety. It has less milk than a latte but both are varieties of coffee to which the milk can be added in such a way as to create 
a decorative surface pattern. Such effects are known as latte art.</p>

					<p>Coffee can also be incorporated with alcohol to produce a variety of beverages: it is combined with whiskey in <em>Irish coffee</em>, 
and it forms the base of alcoholic coffee liqueurs such as <em>Kahlúa</em> and <em>Tia Maria</em>. Darker beers such as <em>stout</em> and <em>porter</em> give a chocolate or coffee-like taste due to roasted 
grains even though actual coffee beans are not added to it.</p>

				<h3>Instant coffee</h3>

					<p>A number of products are sold for the convenience of consumers who do not want to prepare their own coffee or who do not have 
access to coffeemaking equipment. <em>Instant coffee</em> is dried into soluble powder or freeze-dried into granules that can be quickly dissolved in hot water. Originally invented in 1907,
 it rapidly gained in popularity in many countries in the post-war period, with <em>Nescafé</em> being the most popular product. Many consumers determined that the convenience in 
preparing a cup of instant coffee more than made up for a perceived inferior taste, although, since the late 1970s, instant coffee has been produced differently in such a 
way that is similar to the taste of freshly brewed coffee. Paralleling (and complementing) the rapid rise of instant coffee was the coffee vending machine invented 
in 1947 and widely distributed since the 1950s.</p>

					<p>Canned coffee has been popular in Asian countries for many years, particularly in China, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. 
Vending machines typically sell varieties of flavored canned coffee, much like brewed or percolated coffee, available both hot and cold. Japanese convenience stores and 
groceries also have a wide availability of bottled coffee drinks, which are typically lightly sweetened and pre-blended with milk. Bottled coffee drinks are also consumed 
in the United States.</p>

					<p>Liquid coffee concentrates are sometimes used in large institutional situations where coffee needs to be produced for thousands of 
people at the same time. It is described as having a flavor about as good as low-grade robusta coffee, and costs about 10¢ a cup to produce. The machines can process up to 
500 cups an hour, or 1,000 if the water is preheated.</p>


			<h2>Health Effects</h2>

					<p>A 2017 review of clinical trials found that drinking coffee is generally safe within usual levels of intake and is more likely to 
improve health outcomes than to cause harm at doses of 3 or 4 cups of coffee daily. Exceptions include possible increased risk in women having <em>bone fractures</em>, and a 
possible increased risk in pregnant women of <em>fetal loss</em> or <em>decreased birth weight</em>. Results were complicated by poor study quality, and differences in age, gender, 
health status, and serving size.</p>

				<h3>Digestion</h3>
					<p>A 1999 review found that coffee does not cause indigestion, but may promote <em>gastrointestinal reflux</em>. Two reviews of clinical 
studies on people recovering from abdominal, colorectal, and gynecological surgery found that coffee consumption was safe and effective for <em>enhancing postoperative 
gastrointestinal function</em>.</p>

				<h3>Mortality</h3>
					<p>In 2012, the National Institutes of Health–AARP Diet and Health Study found that higher coffee consumption was associated with 
lower risk of death, and that those who drank any coffee lived longer than those who did not. However the authors noted, "whether this was a causal or associational 
finding cannot be determined from our data." A 2014 meta-analysis found that coffee consumption (4 cups/day) was inversely associated with all-cause mortality 
(a 16% lower risk), as well as cardiovascular disease mortality specifically (a 21% lower risk from drinking 3 cups/day), but not with cancer mortality with exception 
being oral cancer mortality.</p>

					<p>Additional meta-analyses corroborated these findings, showing that higher coffee consumption (2–4 cups per day) was associated 
with a reduced risk of death by all disease causes. An association of coffee drinking with reduced risk for death from various sources was confirmed by a widely cited 
prospective cohort study of ten European countries in 2017.</p>

				<h3>Cardiovascular disease</h3>
					<p>Moderate coffee consumption is not a risk factor for coronary heart disease. A 2012 meta-analysis concluded that people 
who drank moderate amounts of coffee had a lower rate of heart failure, with the biggest effect found for those who drank more than four cups a day. A 2014 meta-analysis 
concluded that cardiovascular disease, such as coronary artery disease and stroke, is less likely with three to five cups of non-decaffeinated coffee per day, but 
more likely with over five cups per day. A 2016 meta-analysis showed that coffee consumption was associated with a reduced risk of death in patients who have had a 
myocardial infarction.</p>

					<p>The effect of no or moderate daily consumption of coffee on risk for developing hypertension has been assessed in several 
reviews during the 21st century. A 2019 review found that one to two cups consumed per day had no effect on hypertension risk, whereas drinking three or more cups 
per day reduced the risk, a finding in agreement with a 2017 analysis which showed a 9% lower risk of hypertension with long-term consumption of up to seven cups 
of coffee per day. Another review in 2018 found that the risk of hypertension was reduced by 2% with each one cup per day increment of coffee consumption up to 8 cups 
per day, compared with people who did not consume any coffee. By contrast, a 2011 review had found that drinking one to three cups of coffee per day may pose a 
slightly increased risk of developing hypertension.</p>

				<h3>Mental health</h3>
					<p>The UK NHS advises that avoiding coffee may reduce anxiety. Caffeine, the major active ingredient in coffee, is associated 
with <strong>anxiety</strong>. At high doses, typically greater than 300 mg, caffeine can both cause and worsen anxiety. For some people, discontinuing caffeine use can significantly 
reduce anxiety. Caffeine-induced anxiety disorder is a subclass of substance- or medication-induced anxiety disorder. Populations that may be most impacted 
by caffeine consumption are adolescents and those already suffering anxiety disorders. Preliminary research indicated the possibility of a beneficial relationship 
between coffee intake and reduced depression. Long-term preliminary research, including assessment of symptoms for dementia and cognitive impairment, was inconclusive 
for coffee having an effect in the elderly, mainly due to the poor quality of the studies.</p>

				<h3>Parkinson's disease</h3>
					<p>Meta-analyses have consistently found that long-term coffee consumption is associated with a lower risk of Parkinson's disease.</p>

				<h3>Type II diabetes</h3>
					<p>In a systematic review and meta-analysis of 28 prospective observational studies, representing over one million participants, 
every additional cup of caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee consumed in a day was associated, respectively, with a 9% and 6% lower risk of type 2 diabetes.</p>

				<h3>Cancer</h3>
					<p>Research on the effects of coffee consumption on cancer risk generally has indicated no effect or a slightly lower risk of 
cancer, particularly in the liver.</p>

				<h3>Liver disease</h3>
					<p>Increasing evidence has shown that coffee consumption is protective against the progression of liver disease to cirrhosis. 
This is associated with antioxidant and anti-fibrotic effects of coffee.</p>

				<h3>Pharmacology</h3>

					<p>One psychoactive chemical in coffee is caffeine, an adenosine receptor antagonist that is known for its stimulant effects.
 Coffee also contains the monoamine oxidase inhibitors β-carboline and harmane, which may contribute to its psychoactivity.</p>

					<p>In a healthy liver, caffeine is mostly broken down by hepatic enzymes. The excreted metabolites are mostly paraxanthines—th
eobromine and theophylline—and a small amount of unchanged caffeine. Therefore, the metabolism of caffeine depends on the state of this enzymatic system of the liver.</p>

					<p>Polyphenols in coffee have been shown to affect free radicals in vitro, but there is no evidence that this effect occurs
 in humans. Polyphenol levels vary depending on how beans are roasted as well as for how long. As interpreted by the Linus Pauling Institute and the European Food Safety
 Authority, dietary polyphenols, such as those ingested by consuming coffee, have little or no direct antioxidant value following ingestion.</p>

				<h3>Caffeine content</h3>

					<p>Depending on the type of coffee and method of preparation, the caffeine content of a single serving can vary greatly.
 The caffeine content of a cup of coffee varies depending mainly on the brewing method, and also on the coffee variety. According to the USDA National Nutrient Dat
abase, a 240-millilitre (8 US fl oz) cup of "coffee brewed from grounds" contains 95 mg caffeine, whereas an espresso (25 ml) contains 53 mg.</p>

					
					<p>Caffeine remains stable up to 200 °C (392 °F) and completely decomposes around 285 °C (545 °F). Given that roasting 
temperatures don't exceed 200 °C (392 °F) for long and rarely if ever reach 285 °C (545 °F), the caffeine content of a coffee is not likely changed much by the roasting process.</p>


			<h2>Coffee Houses</h2>

					<p>Widely known as <em>coffeehouses</em> or <em>cafés</em>, establishments serving prepared coffee or other hot beverages have existed for over five 
hundred years. The first coffeehouse in Constantinople was opened in 1475 by traders arriving from Damascus and Aleppo. Soon after, coffeehouses became part of the Ottoman 
culture, spreading rapidly to all regions of the Ottoman Empire.</p>

					<p>Coffeehouses in Mecca became a concern as places for political gatherings to the imams who banned them, and the drink, for
 Muslims between 1512 and 1524. In 1530 the first coffeehouse was opened in Damascus.</p>


					<p>In the 17th century, coffee appeared for the first time in Europe outside the Ottoman Empire, and coffeehouses were established
 and quickly became popular. The first coffeehouses in Western Europe appeared in Venice, as a result of the traffic between La Serenissima and the Ottomans; the very first
 one is recorded in 1645. The first coffeehouse in England was set up in Oxford in 1650 by a Jewish man named Jacob in the building now known as "The Grand Cafe". A plaque o
n the wall still commemorates this; the café is now a cocktail bar. By 1675, there were more than 3,000 coffeehouses in England.</p>


					<p>In 1672 an Armenian named Pascal established a coffee stall in Paris that was ultimately unsuccessful and the city had to
 wait until 1689 for its first coffeehouse when Procopio Cutò opened the Café Procope. This coffeehouse still exists today and was a major meeting place of the French 
Enlightenment; Voltaire, Rousseau, and Denis Diderot frequented it, and it is arguably the birthplace of the Encyclopédie, the first modern encyclopedia. America had its
 first coffeehouse in Boston, in 1676. Coffee, tea and beer were often served together in establishments which functioned both as coffeehouses and taverns; one
 such was the Green Dragon in Boston, where John Adams, James Otis, and Paul Revere planned rebellion.</p>


					<p>The modern steamless espresso machine was invented in Milan, Italy, in 1938 by Achille Gaggia, and from there spread in
 coffeehouses and restaurants across Italy and the rest of Europe in the early 1950s. An Italian named Pino Riservato opened the first espresso bar, the Moka Bar, i
n Soho in 1952, and there were 400 such bars in London alone by 1956. Cappucino was particularly popular among English drinkers.[204] Similarly in the United States, t
he espresso craze spread. North Beach in San Francisco saw the opening of the Caffe Trieste in 1957, which served Beat Generation poets such as Allen Ginsberg and Bob 
Kaufman alongside Italian immigrants. Similar such cafes existed in Greenwich Village and elsewhere.</p>

					<p>The first <strong>Peet's Coffee & Tea</strong> store opened in 1966 in Berkeley, California by Dutch native Alfred Peet. He chose to focus on 
roasting batches with fresher, higher quality seeds than was the norm at the time. He was a trainer and supplier to the founders of Starbucks.</p>

					<p>The American coffeehouse chain <strong>Starbucks</strong>, which began as a modest business roasting and selling coffee beans in 1971, was f
ounded by three college students, Jerry Baldwin, Gordon Bowker, and Zev Siegl. The first store opened on 30 March 1971 at the Pike Place Market in Seattle, followed by
 a second and third over the next two years. Entrepreneur Howard Schultz joined the company in 1982 as Director of Retail Operations and Marketing, and pushed to 
sell premade espresso coffee. The others were reluctant, but Schultz opened Il Giornale in Seattle in April 1986. He bought the other owners out in March 1987 an
d pushed on with plans to expand—from 1987 to the end of 1991, the chain (rebranded from Il Giornale to Starbucks) expanded to over 100 outlets. The company has 25,000 s
tores in over 75 countries worldwide.</p>

					<p>South Korea experienced almost 900 percent growth in the number of coffee shops in the country between 2006 and 2011. The capit
al city Seoul now has the highest concentration of coffee shops in the world, with more than 10,000 cafes and coffeehouses.</p>

					<p>A contemporary term for a person who makes coffee beverages, often a coffeehouse employee, is a <em>barista</em>. The Specialty Coffee 
Association of Europe and the Specialty Coffee Association of America have been influential in setting standards and providing training.</p>


					<p>Coffee is often consumed alongside (or instead of) breakfast by many at home or when eating out at diners or cafeterias.
 It is often served at the end of a formal meal, normally with a dessert, and at times with an after-dinner mint, especially when consumed at a restaurant or dinner
 party.</p>

			<h2>Society and Culture</h2>

				<h3>Break</h3>
					<p>A <em>coffee break</em> in the United States and elsewhere is a short mid-morning rest period granted to employees in business and indu
stry, corresponding with the Commonwealth terms <em>"elevenses"</em>, <em>"smoko"</em> (in Australia), <em>"morning tea"</em>, <em>"tea break"</em>, or even just <em>"tea"</em>. An afternoon coffee break, or afterno
on tea, often occurs as well.</p>

					<p>The coffee break originated in the late 19th century in Stoughton, Wisconsin, with the wives of Norwegian immigrants. The city c
elebrates this every year with the Stoughton Coffee Break Festival. In 1951, Time noted that "Since the war, the coffee break has been written into union contracts".
 The term subsequently became popular through a Pan-American Coffee Bureau ad campaign of 1952 which urged consumers, "Give yourself a Coffee-Break – and Get What Coffee Give
s to You." John B. Watson, a behavioral psychologist who worked with Maxwell House later in his career, helped to popularize coffee breaks within the American culture. Co
ffee breaks usually last from 10 to 20 minutes and frequently occur at the end of the first third of the work shift. In some companies and some civil service, the coffee br
eak may be observed formally at a set hour. In some places, a cart with hot and cold beverages and cakes, breads and pastries arrives at the same time morning and afternoon
, an employer may contract with an outside caterer for daily service, or coffee breaks may take place away from the actual work-area in a designated cafeteria or tea room. M
ore generally, the phrase "coffee break" has also come to denote any break from work.</p>

				<h3>Prohibition and Condemnation</h3>

					<p>At least 1,100 years ago, traders brought coffee across the Red Sea into 
Arabia (modern-day Yemen), where Muslim dervishes began cultivating the shrub in their gardens. At first, the Arabians made wine from the pulp of the fermented coffee berries. 
This beverage was known as qishr (kisher in modern usage) and was used during religious ceremonies.</p>

					<p>An ulema of jurists and scholars meeting in Mecca in 1511 prohibited coffee drinking as haraam, but whether coffee was intoxicating 
was hotly debated over the next 30 years until the ban was finally overturned in the mid-16th century. Use in religious rites among the Sufi branch of Islam led to coffee's
 being put on trial in Mecca: it was accused of being a heretical substance, and its production and consumption were briefly repressed. An edict of Sultan Murad IV
 (r. 1623–1640) later prohibited it in Ottoman Turkey.</p>

					<p>A contemporary example of religious prohibition of coffee can be found in <em>The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</em>.
 The organization regards the consumption of coffee as both physically and spiritually unhealthy. This attitude comes from the Mormon doctrine of health, published
 in 1833 by founder Joseph Smith in a revelation called the "Word of Wisdom". This text does not identify coffee by name, but includes the statement that "hot drinks are 
not for the belly", which Latter-day Saints have interpreted as forbidding both coffee and tea.</p>

					<p>Quite a number of members of the <em>Seventh-day Adventist Church</em> also avoid caffeinated drinks. In its teachings, the Church
 encourages members to avoid tea, coffee, and other stimulants. Abstinence from coffee, tobacco, and alcohol by many Adventists has afforded a near-unique opportunity 
for studies to be conducted within that population group on the health effects of coffee drinking, free from confounding factors. One study showed a weak but statistically s
ignificant association between coffee consumption and mortality from ischemic heart disease, other cardiovascular disease, all cardiovascular diseases combined, and all 
causes of death.</p>

					<p>For a time, controversy existed in the <em>Jewish</em> community over whether the coffee seed was a legume – and therefore prohibited for P
assover. Upon petition from coffeemaker Maxwell House, orthodox Jewish rabbi Hersch Kohn in 1923 classified the coffee seed as a berry rather than as a seed, and therefo
re kosher for Passover.</p>

				<h3>Fair trade</h3>

					<p>The concept of fair trade labeling, which guarantees coffee growers a negotiated preharvest price, began in the late 1980s with the 
Max Havelaar Foundation's labeling program in the Netherlands. In 2004, 24,222 metric tons (of 7,050,000 produced worldwide) were fair trade; in 2005, 33,991 metric tons out 
of 6,685,000 were fair trade, an increase from 0.34% to 0.51%. A number of fair trade impact studies have shown that fair trade coffee produces a mixed impact on the
 communities that grow it. Many studies are skeptical about fair trade, reporting that it often worsens the bargaining power of those who are not part of it. The very first fa
ir-trade coffee was an effort to import a Guatemalan coffee into Europe as "Indio Solidarity Coffee".</p>

					<p>Since the founding of organizations such as the European Fair Trade Association (1987), the production and consumption of f
air trade coffee has grown as some local and national coffee chains started to offer fair trade alternatives. For example, in April 2000, after a year-long 
campaign by the human rights organization Global Exchange, Starbucks decided to carry fair-trade coffee in its stores. Since September 2009 all Starbucks Espress
o beverages in UK and Ireland are made with Fairtrade and Shared Planet certified coffee.</p>

					<p>A 2005 study done in Belgium concluded that consumers' buying behavior is not consistent with their positive attitude tow
ard ethical products. On average 46% of European consumers claimed to be willing to pay substantially more for ethical products, including fair-trade products such a
s coffee. The study found that the majority of respondents were unwilling to pay the actual price premium of 27% for fair trade coffee.</p>

				<h3>Folklore and culture</h3>
					<p>The <em>Oromo</em> people would customarily plant a coffee tree on the graves of powerful sorcerers. They believed that the first
 coffee bush sprang up from the tears that the god of heaven shed over the corpse of a dead sorcerer.</p>

					<p>Johann Sebastian Bach was inspired to compose the humorous Coffee Cantata, about dependence on the beverage, which was 
controversial in the early 18th century.</p>

				<h3>Economic impacts</h3>

					<p>Market volatility, and thus increased returns, during 1830 encouraged Brazilian entrepreneurs to shift their attention from
 gold to coffee, a crop hitherto reserved for local consumption. Concurrent with this shift was the commissioning of vital infrastructures, including approximately 7,00
0 km of railroads between 1860 and 1885. The creation of these railways enabled the importation of workers, to meet the enormous need for labor. This development primaril
y affected the State of Rio de Janeiro, as well as the Southern States of Brazil, most notably São Paulo, due to its favorable climate, soils, and terrain.</p>

					<p>Coffee production attracted immigrants in search of better economic opportunities in the early 1900s. Mainly, these were
 Portuguese, Italian, Spanish, German, and Japanese nationals. For instance, São Paulo received approximately 733,000 immigrants in the decade preceding 1900, whilst
 only receiving approximately 201,000 immigrants in the six years to 1890. The production yield of coffee increases. In 1880, São Paulo produced 1.2 million bags (25
% of total production), in 1888 2.6 million (40%), in 1902 8 million bags (60%). Coffee is then 63% of the country's exports. The gains made by this trade allow
 sustained economic growth in the country.</p>

					<p>The four years between planting a coffee and the first harvest extends seasonal variations in the price of coffee. The Bra
zilian Government is thus forced, to some extent, to keep strong price subsidies during production periods.</p>

				<h3>Competition</h3>
					<p>Coffee competitions take place across the globe with people at the regional competing to achieve national titles and then
 compete on the international stage. World Coffee Events holds the largest of such events moving the location of the final competition each year. The competition incl
udes the following events: <strong>Barista Championship</strong>, <strong>Brewers Cup</strong>, <strong>Latte Art</strong> and <strong>Cup Tasters</strong>. A World Brewer's Cup Championship takes place in Melbourne, Australia, every y
ear that houses contestants from around the world to crown the World's Coffee King.</p>
