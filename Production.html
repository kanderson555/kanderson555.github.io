			<h1>Production</h1>
				<h3>Processing</h3>
					<p>Coffee berries and their seeds undergo several processes before they become the familiar roasted coffee. Berries have been traditi
onally selectively <em>picked by hand</em>; a labor-intensive method, it involves the selection of only the berries at the peak of ripeness. More commonly, crops are <em>strip picked</em>, w
here all berries are harvested simultaneously regardless of ripeness by person or machine. After picking, green coffee is processed by one of two types of method—a dry proc
ess type of method which is often simpler and less labor-intensive, and a wet process type of method, which incorporates <em>batch fermentation</em>, uses larger amounts of water in
 the process, and often yields a milder coffee.</p>

					<p>Then they are <em>sorted by ripeness and color</em>, and most often the flesh of the berry is removed, usually by machine, and the see
ds are fermented to remove the slimy layer of mucilage still present on the seed. When the fermentation is finished, the seeds are <em>washed with large quantities of fresh w
ater</em> to remove the fermentation residue, which generates massive amounts of coffee wastewater. Finally, the seeds are <em>dried</em>.</p>

					<p>The best (but least used) method of drying coffee is using <strong>drying tables</strong>. In this method, the pulped and fermented coffee is 
spread thinly on raised beds, which allows the air to pass on all sides of the coffee, and then the coffee is mixed by hand. In this method the drying that takes pl
ace is more uniform, and fermentation is less likely. Most African coffee is dried in this manner and certain coffee farms around the world are starting to use this 
traditional method.</p>

					<p>Next, the coffee is sorted, and labeled as <strong>green coffee</strong>. Some companies use cylinders to pump in heated air to dry the coffee seeds, though this is generally in places w
here the humidity is very high.</p>

				<h3>Roasting</h3>
					<p>The next step in the process is the <strong>roasting</strong> of the green coffee. Coffee is usually sold in a roasted state, and with rare excepti
ons, such as infusions from green coffee beans, coffee is roasted before it is consumed. It can be sold roasted by the supplier, or it can be home roasted. The roast
ing process influences the taste of the beverage by changing the coffee bean both physically and chemically. The bean decreases in weight as moisture is lost and increases 
in volume, causing it to become less dense. The density of the bean also influences the strength of the coffee and requirements for packaging.</p>

					<p>The actual roasting begins when the temperature inside the bean reaches approximately <strong>200 °C (392 °F)</strong>, though different varie
ties of seeds differ in moisture and density and therefore roast at different rates. During roasting, caramelization occurs as intense heat breaks down starches, cha
nging them to simple sugars that begin to brown, which alters the color of the bean.</p>

					<p>Sucrose is rapidly lost during the roasting process, and may disappear entirely in darker roasts. During roasting, aromat
ic oils and acids weaken, changing the flavor; at 205 °C (401 °F), other oils start to develop. One of these oils, caffeol, is created at about 200 °C (392 °F),
 which is largely responsible for coffee's <em>aroma and flavor</em>.</p>

					<p><strong>Roasting</strong> is the last step of processing the beans in their intact state. During this last treatment, while still in the bean
 state, more caffeine breaks down above 235 °C (455 °F). Dark roasting is the utmost step in bean processing removing the most caffeine. Although, dark roasting is 
<em>not</em> to be confused with the decaffeination process.</p>

				<h3>Grading Roasted Beans</h3>
					<p>Depending on the color of the roasted beans as perceived by the human eye, they will be labeled as <em>light</em>, <em>medium light</em>, <em>medi
um</em>, <em>medium dark</em>, <em>dark</em>, or <em>very dark</em>. A more accurate method of discerning the degree of roast involves measuring the reflected light from roasted seeds illuminated with 
a light source in the near-infrared spectrum. This elaborate light meter uses a process known as spectroscopy to return a number that consistently indicates the roasted 
coffee's relative degree of roast or flavor development.</p>

			<h3>Roast characteristics</h3>
					<p>The <strong>degree of roast</strong> has an effect upon coffee flavor and body. Darker roasts are generally <strong>bolder</strong> because they have less fiber content and a 
more sugary flavor. Lighter roasts have a more complex and therefore <strong>perceived stronger flavor</strong> from aromatic oils and acids otherwise destroyed by longer roasting times. Roasting 
does not alter the amount of caffeine in the bean, but does give less caffeine when the beans are measured by volume because the beans expand during roasting.</p>

					<p>A small amount of chaff is produced during roasting from the skin left on the seed after processing. Chaff is usually removed from the seeds by air movement, though a small amount is added to dark roast coffees to soak up oils on the seeds.[96]

				<h3>Decaffeination</h3>
					<p>Decaffeination of coffee seeds is done while the seeds are <em>still green</em>. Many methods can remove caffeine from coffee, but all involve 
either soaking the green seeds in hot water (often called the <em>"Swiss water process"</em>) or <em>steaming them</em>, then using a <strong>solvent</strong> to dissolve caffeine-containing oils. Decaffeination 
is often done by processing companies, and the extracted caffeine is usually sold to the <strong>pharmaceutical industry</strong>.</p>

				<h3>Storage</h3>

					<p>Coffee is best stored in an airtight container made of <strong>ceramic, glass or non-reactive metal</strong>. Higher quality prepackaged coffee 
usually has a one-way valve which prevents air from entering while allowing the coffee to release gases. Coffee freshness and flavor is preserved when it is stored 
<em>away from</em> moisture, heat, and light. The tendency of coffee to absorb strong smells from food means that it should be kept away from such smells. Storage of coffee in 
refrigerators is <strong>not recommended</strong> due to the presence of moisture which can cause deterioration. Exterior walls of buildings which face the sun may heat the interior of a 
home, and this heat may damage coffee stored near such a wall. Heat from nearby ovens also harms stored coffee.</p>

					<p>In 1931, a method of packing coffee in a sealed vacuum in cans was introduced. The roasted coffee was packed and then 99% of 
the air was removed, allowing the coffee to be stored indefinitely until the can was opened. Today this method is in mass use for coffee in a large part of the world.</p>

				<h3>Brewing</h3>

					<p>Coffee beans must be ground and brewed to create a beverage. The criteria for choosing a method include flavor and economy. Almost 
all methods of preparing coffee require that the beans be <em>ground</em> and then mixed with hot water long enough to allow the flavor to emerge but not so long as to draw out bitter 
compounds. The liquid can be consumed after the spent grounds are removed. Brewing considerations include the <em>fineness of grind</em>, the <em>way in which the water is used to extract 
the flavor</em>, the <em>ratio of coffee grounds to water (the brew ratio)</em>, <em>additional flavorings</em> such as sugar, milk, and spices, and the <em>technique to be used to separate spent grounds</em>. 
Optimal coffee extraction occurs between <strong>91 and 96 °C (196 and 205 °F)</strong>. Ideal holding temperatures range from <strong>85 to 88 °C (185 to 190 °F)</strong> to as high as <strong>93 °C (199 °F)</strong> and 
the ideal serving temperature is <strong>68 to 79 °C (154 to 174 °F)</strong>. The recommended brew ratio for non-espresso coffee is around 55 to 60 grams of grounds per litre of water, or 
<strong>two level tablespoons</strong> for a 150-to-180-millilitre (5 to 6 US fl oz) cup.</p>

					<p>The roasted coffee beans may be ground at a <strong>roastery</strong>, in a <strong>grocery store</strong>, or in <strong>the home</strong>. Most coffee is roasted and ground at a roastery 
and sold in packaged form, though roasted coffee beans can be ground at home immediately before consumption. It is also possible, though uncommon, to <strong>roast raw beans at home</strong>.</p>

					<p>Coffee beans may be ground in various ways. A <em>burr grinder</em> uses revolving elements to shear the seed; a <em>blade grinder</em> cuts the seeds 
with blades moving at high speed; and a <em>mortar and pestle</em> crushes the seeds. For most brewing methods a <em>burr grinder</em> is deemed superior because the grind is more even and the 
grind size can be adjusted.</p>

					<p>The type of grind is often named after the brewing method for which it is generally used. Turkish grind is the finest grind, while 
coffee percolator or French press are the coarsest grinds. The most common grinds are between these two extremes: a medium grind is used in most home coffee-brewing machines.</p>

					<p>Coffee may be brewed by several methods. It may be <em>boiled</em>, <em>steeped</em>, or <em>pressurized</em>.</p>

					<p>Brewing coffee by <em>boiling</em> was the earliest method, and Turkish coffee is an example of this method. It is prepared by grinding 
or pounding the seeds to a <strong>fine powder</strong>, then adding it to water and bringing it to the boil for no more than an instant in a pot called a <em>cezve</em> or, in Greek, a <em>μπρίκι : 
bríki</em> (from Turkish ibrik). This produces a strong coffee with a layer of foam on the surface and sediment (which is not meant for drinking) settling at the bottom of the cup.</p>

					<p>Coffee percolators and automatic coffeemakers brew coffee using gravity. In an automatic coffeemaker, hot water drips onto coffee 
grounds that are held in a paper, plastic, or perforated metal coffee filter, allowing the water to seep through the ground coffee while extracting its oils and essences. 
The liquid drips through the coffee and the filter into a carafe or pot, and the spent grounds are retained in the filter.</p>

					<p>In a percolator, boiling water is forced into a chamber above a filter by steam pressure created by boiling. The water then seeps through the grounds, and the process is 
repeated until terminated by removing from the heat, by an internal timer, or by a thermostat that turns off the heater when the entire pot reaches a certain temperature.</p>

					<p>Coffee may be brewed by steeping in a device such as a <em>French press</em> (also known as a <em>cafetière</em>, <em>coffee press</em> or <em>coffee plunger</em>). 
Ground coffee and hot water are combined 
in a cylindrical vessel and left to brew for a few minutes. A circular filter which fits tightly in the cylinder fixed to a plunger is then pushed down from the top to force 
the grounds to the bottom. The filter retains the grounds at the bottom as the coffee is poured from the container. Because the coffee grounds are in direct contact with the 
water, all the coffee oils remain in the liquid, making it a stronger beverage. This method of brewing leaves more sediment than in coffee made by an automatic coffee machine. 
Supporters of the French press method point out that the sediment issue can be minimized by using the right type of grinder: they claim that a rotary blade grinder cuts the coffee 
bean into a wide range of sizes, including a fine coffee dust that remains as sludge at the bottom of the cup, while a burr grinder uniformly grinds the beans into consistently-
sized grinds, allowing the coffee to settle uniformly and be trapped by the press. Within the first minute of brewing 95% of the caffeine is released from the coffee bean.</p>

					<p>The <em>espresso method</em> forces hot pressurized and vaporized water through ground coffee. As a result of brewing under high pressure 
(typically 9 bar), the espresso beverage is more concentrated (as much as 10 to 15 times the quantity of coffee to water as gravity-brewing methods can produce) and 
has a more complex physical and chemical constitution. A well-prepared espresso has a reddish-brown foam called crema that floats on the surface. Other pressurized 
water methods include the moka pot and vacuum coffee maker.</p>

					<p><em>Cold brew coffee</em> is made by steeping coarsely ground beans in cold water for several hours, then filtering them. This results 
in a brew lower in acidity than most hot-brewing methods.</p>

				<h3>Nutrition</h3>
					<p>Brewed coffee from typical grounds prepared with tap water contains 40 mg caffeine per 100 gram and no essential nutrients in 
significant content.[116] In espresso, however, likely due to its higher amount of suspended solids, there are significant contents of magnesium, the B vitamins, niacin 
and riboflavin, and 212 mg of caffeine per 100 grams of grounds.</p>

				<h3>Serving</h3>

					<p>Once brewed, coffee may be served in a variety of ways. <em>Drip-brewed</em>, <em>percolated</em>, or <em>French-pressed/cafetière</em> coffee may be 
served as white coffee with a dairy product such as milk or cream, or dairy substitute, or as black coffee with no such addition. It may be sweetened with sugar or 
artificial sweetener. When served cold, it is called <em>iced coffee</em>.</p>

					<p><em>Espresso-based coffee</em> has a variety of possible presentations. In its most basic form, an espresso is served alone as a <em>shot</em> 
or <em>short black</em>, or with hot water added, when it is known as <em>Caffè Americano</em>. A <em>long black</em> is made by pouring a double espresso into an equal portion of water, retaining 
the crema, unlike Caffè Americano. Milk is added in various forms to an espresso: steamed milk makes a <em>caffè latte</em>, equal parts steamed milk and milk froth make a 
<em>cappuccino</em>, and a dollop of hot foamed milk on top creates a <em>caffè macchiato</em>. A flat white is prepared by adding steamed hot milk (microfoam) to espresso so that the flavour is 
brought out and the texture is unusually velvety. It has less milk than a latte but both are varieties of coffee to which the milk can be added in such a way as to create 
a decorative surface pattern. Such effects are known as latte art.</p>

					<p>Coffee can also be incorporated with alcohol to produce a variety of beverages: it is combined with whiskey in <em>Irish coffee</em>, 
and it forms the base of alcoholic coffee liqueurs such as <em>Kahlúa</em> and <em>Tia Maria</em>. Darker beers such as <em>stout</em> and <em>porter</em> give a chocolate or coffee-like taste due to roasted 
grains even though actual coffee beans are not added to it.</p>

				<h3>Instant coffee</h3>

					<p>A number of products are sold for the convenience of consumers who do not want to prepare their own coffee or who do not have 
access to coffeemaking equipment. <em>Instant coffee</em> is dried into soluble powder or freeze-dried into granules that can be quickly dissolved in hot water. Originally invented in 1907,
 it rapidly gained in popularity in many countries in the post-war period, with <em>Nescafé</em> being the most popular product. Many consumers determined that the convenience in 
preparing a cup of instant coffee more than made up for a perceived inferior taste, although, since the late 1970s, instant coffee has been produced differently in such a 
way that is similar to the taste of freshly brewed coffee. Paralleling (and complementing) the rapid rise of instant coffee was the coffee vending machine invented 
in 1947 and widely distributed since the 1950s.</p>

					<p>Canned coffee has been popular in Asian countries for many years, particularly in China, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. 
Vending machines typically sell varieties of flavored canned coffee, much like brewed or percolated coffee, available both hot and cold. Japanese convenience stores and 
groceries also have a wide availability of bottled coffee drinks, which are typically lightly sweetened and pre-blended with milk. Bottled coffee drinks are also consumed 
in the United States.</p>

					<p>Liquid coffee concentrates are sometimes used in large institutional situations where coffee needs to be produced for thousands of 
people at the same time. It is described as having a flavor about as good as low-grade robusta coffee, and costs about 10¢ a cup to produce. The machines can process up to 
500 cups an hour, or 1,000 if the water is preheated.</p>
