			<h2>Coffee Houses</h2>

					<p>Widely known as <em>coffeehouses</em> or <em>cafés</em>, establishments serving prepared coffee or other hot beverages have existed for over five 
hundred years. The first coffeehouse in Constantinople was opened in 1475 by traders arriving from Damascus and Aleppo. Soon after, coffeehouses became part of the Ottoman 
culture, spreading rapidly to all regions of the Ottoman Empire.</p>

					<p>Coffeehouses in Mecca became a concern as places for political gatherings to the imams who banned them, and the drink, for
 Muslims between 1512 and 1524. In 1530 the first coffeehouse was opened in Damascus.</p>


					<p>In the 17th century, coffee appeared for the first time in Europe outside the Ottoman Empire, and coffeehouses were established
 and quickly became popular. The first coffeehouses in Western Europe appeared in Venice, as a result of the traffic between La Serenissima and the Ottomans; the very first
 one is recorded in 1645. The first coffeehouse in England was set up in Oxford in 1650 by a Jewish man named Jacob in the building now known as "The Grand Cafe". A plaque o
n the wall still commemorates this; the café is now a cocktail bar. By 1675, there were more than 3,000 coffeehouses in England.</p>


					<p>In 1672 an Armenian named Pascal established a coffee stall in Paris that was ultimately unsuccessful and the city had to
 wait until 1689 for its first coffeehouse when Procopio Cutò opened the Café Procope. This coffeehouse still exists today and was a major meeting place of the French 
Enlightenment; Voltaire, Rousseau, and Denis Diderot frequented it, and it is arguably the birthplace of the Encyclopédie, the first modern encyclopedia. America had its
 first coffeehouse in Boston, in 1676. Coffee, tea and beer were often served together in establishments which functioned both as coffeehouses and taverns; one
 such was the Green Dragon in Boston, where John Adams, James Otis, and Paul Revere planned rebellion.</p>


					<p>The modern steamless espresso machine was invented in Milan, Italy, in 1938 by Achille Gaggia, and from there spread in
 coffeehouses and restaurants across Italy and the rest of Europe in the early 1950s. An Italian named Pino Riservato opened the first espresso bar, the Moka Bar, i
n Soho in 1952, and there were 400 such bars in London alone by 1956. Cappucino was particularly popular among English drinkers. Similarly in the United States, t
he espresso craze spread. North Beach in San Francisco saw the opening of the Caffe Trieste in 1957, which served Beat Generation poets such as Allen Ginsberg and Bob 
Kaufman alongside Italian immigrants. Similar such cafes existed in Greenwich Village and elsewhere.</p>

					<p>The first <strong>Peet's Coffee & Tea</strong> store opened in 1966 in Berkeley, California by Dutch native Alfred Peet. He chose to focus on 
roasting batches with fresher, higher quality seeds than was the norm at the time. He was a trainer and supplier to the founders of Starbucks.</p>

					<p>The American coffeehouse chain <strong>Starbucks</strong>, which began as a modest business roasting and selling coffee beans in 1971, was f
ounded by three college students, Jerry Baldwin, Gordon Bowker, and Zev Siegl. The first store opened on 30 March 1971 at the Pike Place Market in Seattle, followed by
 a second and third over the next two years. Entrepreneur Howard Schultz joined the company in 1982 as Director of Retail Operations and Marketing, and pushed to 
sell premade espresso coffee. The others were reluctant, but Schultz opened Il Giornale in Seattle in April 1986. He bought the other owners out in March 1987 an
d pushed on with plans to expand—from 1987 to the end of 1991, the chain (rebranded from Il Giornale to Starbucks) expanded to over 100 outlets. The company has 25,000 s
tores in over 75 countries worldwide.</p>

					<p>South Korea experienced almost 900 percent growth in the number of coffee shops in the country between 2006 and 2011. The capit
al city Seoul now has the highest concentration of coffee shops in the world, with more than 10,000 cafes and coffeehouses.</p>

					<p>A contemporary term for a person who makes coffee beverages, often a coffeehouse employee, is a <em>barista</em>. The Specialty Coffee 
Association of Europe and the Specialty Coffee Association of America have been influential in setting standards and providing training.</p>


					<p>Coffee is often consumed alongside (or instead of) breakfast by many at home or when eating out at diners or cafeterias.
 It is often served at the end of a formal meal, normally with a dessert, and at times with an after-dinner mint, especially when consumed at a restaurant or dinner
 party.</p>
